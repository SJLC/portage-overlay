K_EXTRAEINFO="This kernel is not officially supported by Gentoo, however, it
should be fairly stable since it's the vanilla kernel source with the latest
ACPI release for that kernel version (the vanilla kernel is a little behind).
If you have a modern laptop or desktop and are having trouble with system
initialization, power management, or setting the CPU frequency, then these
patches may help.  You should also make sure you have the latest BIOS update
from your motherboard or system vendor."
