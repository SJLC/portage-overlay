Description:  Software timer to deal with the Pomodoro Technique.

(quote): "The Pomodoro Technique is a way to get the most out of time 
management.  Turn time into a valuable ally to accomplish what we want 
to do and chart continuous improvement in the way we do it."

Francesco Cirillo created the Pomodoro Technique\u2122 in 1992. It is now 
practiced by professional teams and individuals around the world.

Requirements:

   1. python 2.5.* or higher.
   2. if you are going to install version 2.0 or higher you also need 
      the Python client library for Google data APIs ver. 2.0.6:
      http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gdata/2.0.6 

Installing pyPomodoro:

Download the latest stable version of pyPomodoro:

$ wget http://pypomodoro.googlecode.com/files/pyPomodoro2.3.tgz
$ tar -xvzf pyPomodoro_beta.gz
$ chmod +x run.py
$ python run.py

Configurations:

The only two configurations you can change are the time frame and the 
csv file separator; all these values are in conf/settings.py file.  By 
default, task files are saved as CSV text files.

MAX_TIME=25

CSV_SEPARATOR=','

File archive used to store the counter: number of pomodoro completed 
since pyPomodoro was installed.

COUNTER_FILE_NAME='.pyPomodoro'

This is new in release 2.0: type your google calendar account whether 
you don't want to type it every time in the login dialog.

Moreover, you can change all the GUI massages, labels and title: they 
are placed in conf/messages.py file.
